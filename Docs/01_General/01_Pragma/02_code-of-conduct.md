| Try to the best of my abilities to always arrive on time. If I can’t, I will warn my peers as early as possible. |  |

| Refrain from bothering others, keep my voice low and my presence light. |  |
| Protect the cleanliness of my environment, clean after myself and after others alike. |  |
| Use the short time I have at Codi efficiently and work diligently to achieve as much as I can. |  |
| Be curious about the things I learn, proactive, and dig at least a bit further than I’m officially asked to. |  |
| Consider my failures as part of the learning process and not be ashamed of them. |  |
| Help my fellow students learn when I can. |  |
| Stay motivated despite the inevitable moments of disappointment and failure. |  |


I, the undersigned, hereby confirm that I agree to the above
