# Being on time chart

- Being on time each day is ğŸ”‘x1
- Being on time 10 times in a row is ğŸ”‘x30

- Being late once is minus:
  - nothing if you arrive after 9
  - ğŸ”‘x2 if you arrive after 10
  - ğŸ”‘x4 if you arrive after 11
  - ğŸ”‘x8 if you arrive after 12
  - ğŸ”‘x16 if you arrive after 14
  - ğŸ”‘x32 if you arrive after 15
  - ğŸ”‘x64 if you arrive after 16
  - this continues for each day in which you're absent(so the first hour of the second day is ğŸ”‘x128)

- *Additionally*
  - being late 3 times in a month is minus ğŸ”‘x300
  - being late more than 3 times in a row is minus ğŸ”‘x1000
  - those two are cumulative


If you know you're going to be late or absent, you can require permission. It will cost you:

- ğŸ”‘x1 for the first hour after 10
- ğŸ”‘x2 for the second hour
- ğŸ”‘x3 for the third hour
- and so on, increasing by 1 every hour
- a day costs ğŸ”‘x10
- this continues for each day in which you're absent (so the first hour of the second day is ğŸ”‘x11)

The same rules apply in reverse. Leaving early incurs the same penalty
