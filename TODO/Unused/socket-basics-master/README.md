# Socket Basics

We're going to build a very simple chat app.  
In order to gradually learn to use sockets, we'll begin with something simpler (a button that everyone can click), and then modify and add until we have a chat app.

We will use React and Sockets.

As you know, if you're doing this project in the right order, to run React, we use servers that distribute the compiled React files. However, to run sockets, we also need a server. This could be one and the same, but we will separate them, because:

1. It's a bother to set up
2. In production, we will not use a server to distribute the React compiled files (they will already be compiled)

If the above didn't really make sense, then you're probably going to want to at least ask questions, or maybe do a different exercise first.


## Pre-requisites:

1. Beginner understanding in React
2. Beginner understanding of Node & npm

## Goals:

- Understand sockets
- Understand npm and `package.json`
- Use React to communicate with external APIs
